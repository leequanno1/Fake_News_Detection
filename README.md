# üß† Vietnamese Fake News Detection Using AI

## üìò Overview
This project aims to build an AI-powered system for **detecting fake news** written in **Vietnamese**. The system classifies news articles or social media posts as either **real** or **fake** using machine learning and deep learning models. The models were trained and evaluated on a curated Vietnamese dataset.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Key Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn` for Logistic Regression and Random Forest
  - `TensorFlow` / `Keras` for LSTM and BiLSTM
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling
  - `pyvi`, `underthesea` for Vietnamese NLP preprocessing

## ‚öôÔ∏è Training Pipeline

1. **Text Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning, tokenizing, and removing Vietnamese stopwords.
   
2. **Text Vectorization**  
   - TF-IDF for traditional ML models  
   - Tokenization + padding sequences for LSTM/BiLSTM
   
3. **Model Training**  
   - Train/test split  
   - Model training and validation evaluation

4. **Evaluation & Comparison**  
   - Compare models based on validation accuracy  
   - Select the most effective model for deployment
